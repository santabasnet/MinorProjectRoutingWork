# Minor Project: RoutingWork
This the minor project work of undergraduate students which demonstrates how to group the delivery stations based on the distance metric and uses Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm in each individual groups for route generation. It uses graphhopper with open street map for distance and time calculation.
